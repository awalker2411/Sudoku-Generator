# Sudoku-Generator AKA Sudoku Haven

## User story sudoko
***
As a sudoku enthusiast, I want to be able to access a website where I can play sudoku puzzles of varying difficulties so that I can improve my sudoku skills and stay engaged with the game. The website should allow me to select a puzzle difficulty, provide a comparison for games completed vs games started, and offer hints or solutions if I get stuck. Additionally, the website should have a clean and user-friendly interface that makes it easy for me to navigate and play the puzzles.

This project aims to develop a website that generates and allows the solving of sudoku puzzles of varying difficulties. The website will have a clean and user-friendly interface that makes it easy for users to navigate and play the puzzles.

## Site Features

*Puzzle generator: The website will have the capability to generate sudoku puzzles of different difficulties (e.g. easy, medium, hard) on demand. The puzzles will be generated using a well-known algorithm for generating valid sudoku puzzles.

*Puzzle solver: Users will be able to input the numbers for a puzzle and the website will check if the puzzle is solved correctly.

*Difficulty selector: Users will be able to select the difficulty level of the puzzles they want to generate or solve.

*Win/Started: Users will be able to track their started games vs number actually completed via numerical value on the screen.

*Hints/solution: If a user gets stuck on a puzzle, they will be able to request a hint that will give the next number to be placed or the complete solution if they can't continue.

The website will be developed using modern web development technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end and Python/Django for the back-end. The website will be tested for functionality and performance before it is deployed for public use.
