# Sudoku-Generator AKA Sudoku Haven

## User story sudoko
***
As a sudoku enthusiast, I want to be able to access a website where I can play sudoku puzzles of varying difficulties so that I can improve my sudoku skills and stay engaged with the game. The website should allow me to select a puzzle difficulty, provide a comparison for games completed vs games started, and offer hints or solutions if I get stuck. Additionally, the website should have a clean and user-friendly interface that makes it easy for me to navigate and play the puzzles.

This project aims to develop a website that generates and allows the solving of sudoku puzzles of varying difficulties. The website will have a clean and user-friendly interface that makes it easy for users to navigate and play the puzzles.

## Site Features

*Puzzle generator: The website will have the capability to generate sudoku puzzles of different difficulties (e.g. easy, medium, hard) on demand. The puzzles will be generated using a well-known algorithm for generating valid sudoku puzzles.

*Puzzle solver: Users will be able to input the numbers for a puzzle and the website will check if the puzzle is solved correctly.

*Difficulty selector: Users will be able to select the difficulty level of the puzzles they want to generate or solve.

*Win/Started: Users will be able to track their started games vs number actually completed via numerical value on the screen.

*Hints/solution: If a user gets stuck on a puzzle, they will be able to request a hint that will give the next number to be placed or the complete solution if they can't continue.

*Quote of the Day: When a user loads up our website they will be greeted with a ranomdly generated quote to help motive them for their day.

The website will be developed using modern web development technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end. The website will be tested for functionality and performance before it is deployed for public use.
